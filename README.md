# Flet Learning Project: YesChat.ai Guided

This repository contains Flet (Python UI framework) projects created as part of my self-taught journey. I leveraged the assistance of YesChat.ai and Google Gemini to explore and understand Flet's capabilities.

## About This Project

This project reflects my hands-on learning experience with Flet. Each file represents a step in my learning process, demonstrating various Flet concepts and features.

**Key Objectives:**

* **Self-Learning:** To independently learn and master the Flet framework.
* **YesChat.ai Assistance:** To utilize YesChat.ai as a guide and resource for understanding Flet's functionalities.
* **Google Gemini Assistance:** To utilize Google Gemini for providing examples and explanations, for finding find and fixing errors, and for creating clear and informative comments.
* **Practical Examples:** To create and document practical examples of Flet layouts, controls, and event handling.

## Contents

This repository initialy includes:

* Flet application examples showcasing:
    * Basic UI elements (Text, Buttons, etc.)
    * Layouts (Column, Row, Stack, Container)
    * Event handling and dynamic UI updates
* Comments within the code for clarity and understanding.
* This README file to explain the purpose and context of the project.

## How to Run

To run the Flet applications:

1.  **Install Flet:**
    ```bash
    pip install flet
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd flet_yeschat_ai
    ```
3.  **Run a specific Python file:**
    ```bash
    python [filename.py]
    ```
    * Replace `[filename.py]` with the name of the Python file you want to run (e.g., `layout_column.py`, `button_interaction.py`).

## Learning Process

My learning process involves:

* The structural guidance of YesChat.ai for explanations of Flet concepts.
* Using Google Gemini to refine and comment code examples, and specific Flet features.
* Adapting and experimenting with the provided examples.
* Troubleshooting and debugging with Gemini's guidance.
* Documenting my learning through comments and side documents in the project.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to YesChat.ai and gemini.google.com for their invaluable assistance throughout this learning journey. Their ability to provide clear explanations and helpful code examples significantly accelerated my understanding of Flet.
